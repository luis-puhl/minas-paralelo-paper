Yu",,"2017","IEEE Digital Library","1-2",,"Deployment of IoT devices for smart buildings and homes will offer a high level of comfortability with increased energy efficiency; but can also introduce potential cyber-attacks such as network intrusions via linked IoT devices. Due to the low-power and low-latency requirement to secure IoT network, traditional software based security system is not applicable. Instead, an embedded hardware-accelerator based data analytics is more preferred for network intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose an online sequential machine learning hardware accelerator to perform realtime network intrusion detection. A single hidden layer feedforward neural network based learning algorithm is developed with a least-squares solver realized on hardware. Experimental results on a single FPGA achieve a bandwidth of 409.6 Gbps with fast yet low-power network intrusion detection based on a number of benchmarks.","inproceedings","10.1145/3125502.3125532",,,,"computer network security;feedforward neural nets;field programmable gate arrays;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;IoT network intrusion detection;smart buildings;embedded hardware-accelerator based data analytics;low-power network intrusion detection;cyber-attacks;software based security system;fast online sequential learning accelerator;IoT device deployment;online sequential machine learning hardware accelerator;feedforward neural network based",,,,,"não descreve o ataque","43383,7914930556","43383,8016319444","luispuhl","luispuhl","Rejected",

Motivated by this real-world security vulnerability, in this paper we propose a novel proximity-based mechanism for IoT device authentication, called Move2Auth, for the purpose of enhancing IoT device security. In Move2Auth, we require user to hold smartphone and perform one of two hand-gestures (moving towards and away, and rotating) in front of IoT device. By combining (1) large RSS-variation and (2) matching between RSS-trace and smartphone sensor-trace, Move2Auth can reliably detect proximity and authenticate IoT device accordingly.

Taleb","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","2017","IEEE Digital Library","9381-9393","66","The Internet of Things (IoT) technology incorporates a large number of heterogeneous devices connected to untrusted networks. Nevertheless, securing IoT devices is a fundamental issue due to the relevant information handled in IoT networks. The intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most commonly used technique to detect intruders and acts as a second wall of defense when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining the advantages of anomaly and signature detection techniques, which are characterized by high detection rates and low false positives, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior of a node, and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected, it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection technique for attack confirmation. Activating the anomaly detection technique simultaneously at each low-resource IoT device and all the time could generate a high-energy consumption. Thereby, we propose a game theoretic technique to activate anomaly detection technique only when a new attack's signature is expected to occur; hence, a balance between detection and false positive rates, and energy consumption is achieved. Even by combining between these two detection techniques, we observed that the number of false positives is still non null (almost equal to 5%). Thereby, to decrease further the false positive rate, a reputation model based on game theory is proposed. Simulation results show that this lightweight anomaly detection outperforms current anomaly detection techniques, since in scaling mode (i.e., when the number of IoT devices and attackers are high) it requires low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high detection and low false positive rates, almost 93% and 2%, respectively.","article","10.1109/TVT.2017.2701551",,,,"computer network security;cryptography;game theory;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);anomaly detection technique;signature detection technique;low-resource IoT device;game theoretic technique;false positive rate;lightweight anomaly detection;low false positive rates;IoT networks;intrusion detection system;Internet of Things;heterogeneous devices;accurate security game;IDS;cryptography;learning algorithm;attack patter detection;attack confirmation;energy consumption;reputation",,"0018-9545",,,"ataque à rede IoT","43383,7914930556","43384,0803819444","luispuhl","luispuhl","Accepted",

Therefore, social networks using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been constructed. As ICT continues to be used in various modern applications, security vulnerabilities from legacy ICT have been inherited by social IoT network systems. To guarantee the safety of these applications, these networks must be protected from various cyberattacks. A variety of security technologies and products have been developed for this purpose. However, the most important task in dealing with cyberattacks is to inspect the current security status of a social IoT network system. Many types of vulnerability quantification methods exist for inspecting the security vulnerabilities of network systems. However, with legacy methods, quantification results lack objectivity. In this study, to compensate for this limitation, we propose a game-theory-based vulnerability quantification method using attack tree, which consists of three steps: game strategy modeling, cost-impact analyzation, and payoff calculation. We present a case study for a social-IoT-based network environment. Using the proposed method, we believe social IoT network system security experts will be able to cope with security incidents more effectively. The proposed method can be used as a reference for constructing a safer social IoT network system.","article","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2017.09.032","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17308440",,,"Game theory, Cyber security, Vulnerability Quantification, Social IoT",,"0167-739X",,,,"43383,7980324074","43383,8563310185","luispuhl","luispuhl","Rejected","?????"

The threats have become so pervasive that every connected electronic device needs to have a cybersecurity strategy. Paradoxically, unprotected devices may even decrease security if they are vulnerable to attack and control by hackers. Recent compromises of networked security cameras to form a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet illustrate this danger. One of the key methods of prevention is to maintain up-to-date firmware on all security devices. Unfortunately, the burden this places on end users is generally unsustainable without some form of automation or the use of a service provider who can manage devices on the user's behalf. Complicating matters is that connected security (and IoT) devices often fall in a governance gap between physical security and IT organizations.","incollection","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-805095-8.00009-0","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128050958000090",,,"Cybersecurity, Cloud security, Governance, Firmware, Updates, Standards, Managed security services","Butterworth-Heinemann",,,,,"43383,7980324074","43383,8624537037","luispuhl","luispuhl","Rejected",

Recently, attackers have initiated increasingly coordinated attack activities commonly pertaining to botnets. However, how to effectively detect the botnet based on attacker activities is proven challenging. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-based method for modeling attacker activities based on the following intuitive observations: attackers in the same botnet tend to launch temporally close attacks. We then directly model attack temporal patterns using a special class of point process called Multivariate Hawkes Process. Intuitively, Multivariate Hawkes Process identifies the latent influences between attackers by utilizing the mutually exciting properties. We then cluster the attacker activities based on the inferred weighted influence matrix with resort to the graph-based clustering approach. To evaluate the applicability of our method, we deployed 10 honeypots in a real-world environment, and conduct experiments on the collected dataset. The results show that we can identify the activity pattern and the structure of botnets effectively.","article","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2018.04.065","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025518303311",,,"IoT, Botnet, Multivariate Hawkes Process",,"0020-0255",,,"ataque à rede IoT","43383,7980324074","43384,0803125","luispuhl","luispuhl","Accepted",

The volume of transmitted data over the various sensors is growing accordingly. Sensors typically are low in resources of storage, memory and processing power. Data security and privacy are part of the major concerns and drawbacks of this growing domain. Sensor traffic analysis has become an increasingly important domain to protect IoT infrastructures from intruders. An IoT network intrusion detection system is required to monitor and analyze the traffic and predict possible attacks. Machine leaning techniques can automatically extract normal and abnormal patterns from a large set of training sensors data. Due to the high volume of traffic and the need for real-time reaction, accurate threat discovery is mandatory. This work focuses on designing a lightweight comprehensive IoT rules generation and execution framework. It is composed of three components, a machine learning rule discovery, a threat prediction model builder and tools to ensure timely reaction to rules violation and un-standardized and ongoing changes in traffic behavior. The generated detection model is expected to identify in real-time exceptions and notify the system accordingly. We use Random-Forest (RF) as the machine learning platform for rules discovery and real-time anomaly detection. To allow RF adaptation to IoT we propose several improvements to make it lightweight and propose a process that combines IoT network capabilities; messaging and resource sharing, to build a comprehensive and efficient IoT security framework.","article","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jisa.2017.03.001","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214212616302332",,,"Internet of Things, Security, Rules extraction, Random-Forest, Active learning",,"2214-2126",,,"descreve técnica de detecção genérica","43383,7980324074","43383,8856134259","luispuhl","luispuhl","Rejected",

The smart cities are realized by using IT based services in the domain of transportation, health care, building management and so forth. In order to provide these services, vital information has to be sensed and disseminated using Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, which are sparsely deployed in a smart city. These devices have low end processors and sometimes, they are installed in places where battery replacement is not feasible. In addition, they are also vulnerable to security attacks by the malicious nodes. There are a lot of recent attacks where IoT networks have been targeted by the hackers to launch a coordinated cyber attacks on some web domains. Therefore, there is a need to develop secure IoT solutions for smart cities that consume low energy. Due to its lightweight but powerful mechanisms, trust management is a promising technology to establish security for the heavily resource-constrained devices that are characteristic of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we develop an approach using trust management and investigate how it can be improved to work more energy-friendly. In particular, we adapt our mechanism to the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol.

Variations can occur in data formats, frequency of operation, or type of communication protocols supported. The ability to support integration between sensors using a “hub” has become central to address many of these issues. The implementation of such a hub can provide both the ability to act as an aggregator for various sensors, and also limit an attacker’s visibility into locally provisioned sensing capability. This paper introduces EclipseIoT, an adaptive hub which uses dynamically loadable add-on modules to communicate with diverse IoT devices, provides policy-based access control, limits exposure of local IoT devices through cloaking, and offers a canary-function based capability to monitor attack behaviours. Its architecture and implementation are discussed, along with its use within a smart home testbed consisting of commercially available devices such as Phillips Hue Bridge, Samsung Smart Things Hub, TP-Link Smart Plug, and TP-Link Smart Camera. The effectiveness of EclipseIoT is further evaluated by simulating various attacks such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing, Media Access Control (MAC) address spoofing, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), port scanning, capturing handshakes, sniffing, and Denial of Service (DoS).

IoT networks characteristics, such as objects heterogeneity and scalability, require revolutionary solutions. Currently, there is no universal architecture for IoT. However, several architectures were proposed based on Software Defined Networks (SDN). SDN introduces network programmability, and centralisation, these features facilitate network abstractions, simplifying network management and eases evolution. In this paper, we investigate SDN as a novel communication architecture for IoT networking to enhance the security and resilience of IoT. SDN enhances network resilience and scalability which are essential in large-scale IoT deployments, e.g., smart cities. However, security is a significant concern for IoT while SDN deepens these concerns. SDN itself presents new security threats; specifically, threats related to the controller.

We propose a secure, framework for IoT based on SDN. The framework is generalization for the integration of SDN and IoT. We focus on massive IoT deployment, for instance, smart cities applications, where, security is critical, and network traffic is enormous. The study investigates the SDN architecture from a security perspective. Improving SDN security will boost the deployment of SDN-based IoT architecture.

In this paper, we explore the potential of using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) deep learning in detecting IoT malware. Specifically, our approach uses RNN to analyze ARM-based IoT applications’ execution operation codes (OpCodes). To train our models, we use an IoT application dataset comprising 281 malware and 270 benign ware. Then, we evaluate the trained model using 100 new IoT malware samples (i.e. not previously exposed to the model) with three different Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) configurations. Findings of the 10-fold cross validation analysis show that the second configuration with 2-layer neurons has the highest accuracy (98.18%) in the detection of new malware samples. A comparative summary with other machine learning classifiers also demonstrate that the LSTM approach delivers the best possible outcome.","article","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2018.03.007","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X1732486X",,,"ARM-based IoT malware detection, IoT malware detection, Long short term memory, Machine learning, OpCodes analysis, Deep learning threat hunting",,"0167-739X",,,"descreve técnica de detecção genérica","43383,7980324074","43383,9425810185","luispuhl","luispuhl","Rejected",

Recent headlines highlight the lack of effective security mechanisms in IoT devices. Security threats in IoT arise not only from vulnerabilities in individual devices but also from the composition of devices in unanticipated ways and the ability of devices to interact through both cyber and physical channels. Existing approaches provide methods for monitoring cyber interactions between devices but fail to consider possible physical interactions. To overcome this challenge, it is essential that security assessments of IoT networks take a holistic view of the network and treat it as a ""system of systems"", in which security is defined, not solely by the individual systems, but also by the interactions and trust dependencies between systems.

In this paper, we propose a way of modeling cyber and physical interactions between IoT devices of a given network. By verifying the cyber and physical interactions against user-defined policies, our model can identify unexpected chains of events that may be harmful. It can also be applied to determine the impact of the addition (or removal) of a device into an existing network with respect to dangerous device interactions.

We demonstrate the viability of our approach by instantiating our model using Alloy, a language and tool for relational models. In our evaluation, we considered three realistic IoT use cases and demonstrate that our model is capable of identifying potentially dangerous device interactions. We also measure the performance of our approach with respect to the CPU runtime and memory consumption of the Alloy model finder, and show that it is acceptable for smart-home IoT networks.","inproceedings","10.1145/3140241.3140252","http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3140241.3140252",,,"alloy, cyber physical systems, device interaction modeling, internet of things, security and privacy","ACM",,,,,"43383,7940046296","43384,0802546296","luispuhl","luispuhl","Accepted",

When a customer forgets his password, he can use his mobile phone to receive a verification code that is sent by the Short Message Service (SMS) to authenticate and reset his password. If an attacker gains this code, he can steal the victim's account (reset password or login directly) to control the IoT device.

Meanwhile, honeypot-based deception mechanism has been considered as one of the methods to ensure security for modern networks in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we address the problem of defending against attacks in honeypot-enabled networks by looking at a game-theoretic model of deception involving an attacker and a defender. The attacker may try to deceive the defender by employing different types of attacks ranging from a suspicious to a seemingly normal activity, while the defender in turn can make use of honeypots as a tool of deception to trap attackers. The problem is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete information, where equilibria are identified for both the one-shot game and the repeated game versions. Our results show that there is a threshold for the frequency of active attackers, above which both players will take deceptive actions and below which the defender can mix up his/her strategy while keeping the attacker's success rate low.","article","10.1109/JIOT.2016.2547994",,,,"computer network security;game theory;Internet of Things;radio networks;deceptive attack;defense game;honeypot enabled networks;Internet of Things;information and communications technologies;cyber attacks;wireless connection;malicious hacking;IoT;game theoretic model;trap attackers;Bayesian game;Internet of things;Bayes methods;Intrusion detection;Game theory;Mathematical model;Attacks and defenses;deception;game theory;honeypots;Internet of Things (IoT);network security",,"2327-4662",,,,"43383,7914930556","43384,0803587963","luispuhl","luispuhl","Accepted",

Sometimes, IoT device sends confidential data that should only be accessed by authorized people or devices.

We undertake a collection and analysis process, constrained by the limitations placed upon three types of adversaries, namely: forensic passive, forensic active and real-time active. The former two adversaries aim to comply with the requirements of forensic soundness, whereas the real-time active adversary does not have these constraints and therefore more closely models a malicious real-world attacker.
The findings show that a variety of device data is available to even the passive adversary, and this data can be used to determine the actions and/or presence of an individual at a given time based on their interactions with the IoT device.
