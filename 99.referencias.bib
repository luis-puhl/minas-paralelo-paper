abstract = {Various communication protocols are currently used in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the protocols that are already standardized by ISO is MQTT protocol (ISO / IEC 20922: 2016). Many IoT developers use this protocol because of its minimal bandwidth requirement and low memory consumption. Sometimes, IoT device sends confidential data that should only be accessed by authorized people or devices. Unfortunately, the MQTT protocol only provides authentication for the security mechanism which, by default, does not encrypt the data in transit thus data privacy, authentication, and data integrity become problems in MQTT implementation. This paper discusses several reasons on why there are many IoT system that does not implement adequate security mechanism. Next, it also demonstrates and analyzes how we can attack this protocol easily using several attack scenarios. Finally, after the vulnerabilities of this protocol have been examined, we can improve our security awareness especially in MQTT protocol and then implement security mechanism in our MQTT system to prevent such attack. {\textcopyright} 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is the smart network which connects smart objects over the Internet. The Internet is un- trusted and unreliable network and thus IoT network is vulner- able to different kind of attacks. Conventional encryption and authentication techniques sometimes fail on IoT based network and intrusion may succeed to destroy the network. So, it is necessary to design intrusion detection system for such network. In our paper, we detect routing attacks such as sinkhole and selective forwarding. We have also tried to prevent our net- work from these attacks. We designed detection and prevention algorithm, i.e., KMA(Key Match Algorithm) and CBA(Cluster- Based Algorithm) in MatLab simulation environment. We gave two intrusion detection mechanisms and compared their results as well. True positive intrusion detection rate for our work is between 50{\%} to 80{\%} with KMA and 76{\%} to 96{\%} with CBA algorithm.},

title = {{Cyber-physical systems information gathering: A smart home case study}},
abstract = {With the growth in the use of Cyber-Physical Systems, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is a corresponding increase in the potential attack footprint of personal and corporate users. In this paper, we explore the potential for exploiting information retrieved from two IoT devices which, seemingly, are unlikely to store substantial amounts of data. We specifically focus on prominent smart home devices for the purpose of obtaining compromising information. We undertake a collection and analysis process, constrained by the limitations placed upon three types of adversaries, namely: forensic passive, forensic active and real-time active. The former two adversaries aim to comply with the requirements of forensic soundness, whereas the real-time active adversary does not have these constraints and therefore more closely models a malicious real-world attacker. The findings show that a variety of device data is available to even the passive adversary, and this data can be used to determine the actions and/or presence of an individual at a given time based on their interactions with the IoT device. These interactions can be both user initiated (e.g. powering on or off a switch or light) and device initiated (e.g. background polling).},

abstract = {In this paper, we present two web-based attacks against local IoT de- vices that any malicious web page or third-party script can perform, even when the devices are behind NATs. In our attack scenario, a victim visits the attacker's website, which contains a malicious script that communicates with IoT devices on the local network that have open HTTP servers. We show how the malicious script can circumvent the same-origin policy by exploiting error messages on the HTML5 MediaError interface or by carrying out DNS rebinding attacks. We demonstrate that the attacker can gather sensitive infor- mation from the devices (e.g., unique device identifiers and precise geolocation), track and profile the owners to serve ads, or control the devices by playing arbitrary videos and rebooting. We propose potential countermeasures to our attacks that users, browsers, DNS providers, and IoT vendors can implement.},

@techreport{Zaharia,
abstract = {MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in implementing large-scale data-intensive applications on commodity clusters. However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper fo-cuses on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.},

With the developments in the technology, Internet of Things (IoT) become important part of human life. However, it is not well defined and secure. Now, various security issues are considered as major problem for a full-fledged IoT environment. There exists a lot of security challenges with the proposed architectures and the technologies which make the backbone of the Internet of Things. Some efficient and promising security mechanisms have been developed to secure the IoT environment, however, there is a lot to do. The challenges are ever increasing and the solutions have to be ever improving. Therefore, aim of this paper is to discuss the history, background, statistics of IoT and security based analysis of IoT architecture. In addition, we will provide taxonomy of security challenges in IoT environment and taxonomy of various defense mechanisms. We conclude our paper discussing various research challenges that still exist in the literature, which provides better understanding of the problem, current solution space, and future research directions to defend IoT against different attacks.},
