  title={{Attack scenarios and security analysis of mqtt communication protocol in iot system}},
  author={Andy,Syaiful and Rahardjo,Budi and Hanindhito,Bagus},
  abstract={Various communication protocols are currently used in the Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices. One of the protocols that are already standardized by
    ISO is MQTT protocol (ISO / IEC 20922: 2016). Many IoT developers use this
    protocol because of its minimal bandwidth requirement and low memory
    consumption. Sometimes,IoT device sends confidential data that should only be
    accessed by authorized people or devices. Unfortunately,the MQTT protocol only
    provides authentication for the security mechanism which,by default,does not
    encrypt the data in transit thus data privacy,authentication,and data
    integrity become problems in MQTT implementation. This paper discusses several
    reasons on why there are many IoT system that does not implement adequate
    security mechanism. Next,it also demonstrates and analyzes how we can attack
    this protocol easily using several attack scenarios. Finally,after the
    vulnerabilities of this protocol have been examined,we can improve our
    security awareness especially in MQTT protocol and then implement security
    mechanism in our MQTT system to prevent such attack. {\textcopyright}

  abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is the smart network which connects smart objects over the Internet. The Internet is un- trusted and unreliable network and thus IoT network is vulner- able to different kind of attacks. Conventional encryption and authentication techniques sometimes fail on IoT based network and intrusion may succeed to destroy the network. So,it is necessary to design intrusion detection system for such network. In our paper,we detect routing attacks such as sinkhole and selective forwarding. We have also tried to prevent our net- work from these attacks. We designed detection and prevention algorithm,i.e.,KMA(Key Match Algorithm) and CBA(Cluster- Based Algorithm) in MatLab simulation environment. We gave two intrusion detection mechanisms and compared their results as well. True positive intrusion detection rate for our work is between 50{\%} to 80{\%} with KMA and 76{\%} to 96{\%} with CBA algorithm.},

  title={Cyber-physical systems information gathering: A smart home case study},
  abstract={With the growth in the use of Cyber-Physical Systems,such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices,there is a corresponding increase in the potential attack footprint of personal and corporate users. In this paper,we explore the potential for exploiting information retrieved from two IoT devices which,seemingly,are unlikely to store substantial amounts of data. We specifically focus on prominent smart home devices for the purpose of obtaining compromising information. We undertake a collection and analysis process,constrained by the limitations placed upon three types of adversaries,namely: forensic passive,forensic active and real-time active. The former two adversaries aim to comply with the requirements of forensic soundness,whereas the real-time active adversary does not have these constraints and therefore more closely models a malicious real-world attacker. The findings show that a variety of device data is available to even the passive adversary,and this data can be used to determine the actions and/or presence of an individual at a given time based on their interactions with the IoT device. These interactions can be both user initiated (e.g. powering on or off a switch or light) and device initiated (e.g. background polling).},

@article{Acar2018,
  abstract={In this paper,we present two web-based attacks against local IoT de- vices that any malicious web page or third-party script can perform,even when the devices are behind NATs. In our attack scenario,a victim visits the attacker's website,which contains a malicious script that communicates with IoT devices on the local network that have open HTTP servers. We show how the malicious script can circumvent the same-origin policy by exploiting error messages on the HTML5 MediaError interface or by carrying out DNS rebinding attacks. We demonstrate that the attacker can gather sensitive infor- mation from the devices (e.g.,unique device identifiers and precise geolocation),track and profile the owners to serve ads,or control the devices by playing arbitrary videos and rebooting. We propose potential countermeasures to our attacks that users,browsers,DNS providers,and IoT vendors can implement.},

  abstract={MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in
  implementing large-scale data-intensive applications on commodity clusters.
  However,most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model
  that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper fo-cuses on
  one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across
  multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning
  algorithms,as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new
  framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the
  scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals,Spark
  introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD
  is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that
  can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in
  iterative machine learning jobs,and can be used to interactively query a 39
  GB dataset with sub-second response time.}

abstract={Internet technology is very pervasive today. The number of devices connected to the Internet,those with a digital identity,is increasing day by day. With the developments in the technology,Internet of Things (IoT) become important part of human life. However,it is not well defined and secure. Now,various security issues are considered as major problem for a full-fledged IoT environment. There exists a lot of security challenges with the proposed architectures and the technologies which make the backbone of the Internet of Things. Some efficient and promising security mechanisms have been developed to secure the IoT environment,however,there is a lot to do. The challenges are ever increasing and the solutions have to be ever improving. Therefore,aim of this paper is to discuss the history,background,statistics of IoT and security based analysis of IoT architecture. In addition,we will provide taxonomy of security challenges in IoT environment and taxonomy of various defense mechanisms. We conclude our paper discussing various research challenges that still exist in the literature,which provides better understanding of the problem,current solution space,and future research directions to defend IoT against different attacks.},

  abstract={Most existing data stream classification techniques ignore one
  important aspect of stream data: arrival of a novel class. We address this issue
  and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class
  detection mechanism into traditional classifiers,enabling automatic detection
  of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive.
  Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of
  concept-drift,when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In
  order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class,the
  classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover
  similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time Tc is imposed
  as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore,most existing
  stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can
  be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality,a time
  delay Tl is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual
  labeling is time consuming. We show how to make fast and correct classification
  decisions under these constraints and apply them to real benchmark data.
  Comparison with state-of-the-art stream classification techniques prove the
  superiority of our approach. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.}

  abstract={Data stream mining is an emergent research area that aims at
  extracting knowledge from large amounts of continuously generated data.
  Novelty detection (ND) is a classification task that assesses if one or a set
  of examples differ significantly from the previously seen examples. This is an
  important task for data stream, as new concepts may appear, disappear or
  evolve over time. Most of the works found in the ND literature presents it as
  a binary classification task. In several data stream real life problems, ND
  must be treated as a multiclass task, in which, the known concept is composed
  by one or more classes and different new classes may appear. This work
  proposes MINAS, an algorithm for ND in data streams. MINAS deals with ND as a
  multiclass task. In the initial training phase, MINAS builds a decision model
  based on a labeled data set. In the online phase, new examples are classified
  using this model, or marked as unknown. Groups of unknown examples can be used
  later to create valid novelty patterns (NP), which are added to the current
  model. The decision model is updated as new data come over the stream in order
  to reflect changes in the known classes and allow the addition of NP. This
  work also presents a set of experiments carried out comparing MINAS and the
  main novelty detection algorithms found in the literature, using artificial
  and real data sets. The experimental results show the potential of the
  proposed algorithm.},

  author={Stonebraker,Michael and çetintemel,Uǧur and Zdonik,Stan},
  abstract={Applications that require real-time processing of high-volume data steams are pushing the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. These stream-based applications include market feed processing and electronic trading on Wall Street,network and infrastructure monitoring,fraud detection,and command and control in military environments. Furthermore,as the "sea change" caused by cheap micro-sensor technology takes hold,we expect to see everything of material significance on the planet get "sensor- tagged" and report its state or location in real time. This sensorization of the real world will lead to a "green field" of novel monitoring and control applications with high-volume and low-latency processing requirements. Recently,several technologies have emerged - including off-the-shelf stream processing engines - specifically to address the challenges of processing high-volume,real-time data without requiring the use of custom code. At the same time,some existing software technologies,such as main memory DBMSs and rule engines,are also being "repurposed" by marketing departments to address these applications. In this paper,we outline eight requirements that a system software should meet to excel at a variety of real-time stream processing applications. Our goal is to provide high-level guidance to information technologists so that they will know what to look for when evaluation alternative stream processing solutions. As such,this paper serves a purpose comparable to the requirements papers in relational DBMSs and on-line analytical processing. We also briefly review alternative system software technologies in the context of our requirements. The paper attempts to be vendor neutral,so no specific commercial products are mentioned.},

abstract="An Intrusion Detection System (IDS)Intrusion Detection Systemis a security mechanism that is intended to dynamically inspect traffic in order to detect any suspicious behaviour or launched attacks. However,it is a challenging task to apply IDS for large and high dimensional data streams. Data streams have characteristics that are quite distinct from those of statistical databases,which greatly impact on the performance of the anomaly-based ID algorithms used in the detection process. These characteristics include,but are not limited to,the processing of large data as they arrive (real-time),the dynamic nature of data streams,the curse of dimensionality,limited memory capacity and high complexity. Therefore,the main challenge in this area of research is to design efficient data-driven ID systems that are capable of efficiently dealing with data streams by considering these specific traffic characteristics. This chapter provides an overview of some of the relevant work carried out in three major fields related to the topic,namely feature selections (FS),intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly detectionAnomaly detection in multi data streams. This overview is intended to provide the reader with a better understanding of the major recent works in the area. By critically investigating and combining those three fields,researchers and practitioners will be better able to develop efficient and robust IDS for data streams. At the end of this chapter,we provide two basic models: an Unsupervised Feature Selection to Improve Detection Accuracy for Anomaly Detection (UFSAD) and its extension (UFSAD-MS) for multi streams,that could reduce the volume and the dimensionality of the big data resulting from the streams. The reduction is based on the selection of only the relevant features and removing irrelevant and redundant ones. The last section of the chapter provides an example of the developed UFSAD model,followed by some experimental results. UFSAD-MS is provided as a conceptual model as it is in the implementation phase.",

  abstract={Evaluating anomaly detectors is a crucial task in traffic
  monitoring made particularly difficult due to the lack of ground truth. The
  goal of the present article is to assist researchers in the evaluation of
  detectors by providing them with labeled anomaly traffic traces. We aim at
  automatically finding anomalies in the MAWI archive using a new methodology
  that combines different and independent detectors. A key challenge is to
  compare the alarms raised by these detectors ,though they operate at
  different traffic granularities. The main contribution is to propose a
  reliable graph-based methodology that combines any anomaly detector outputs.
  We evaluated four unsupervised combination strategies; the best is the one
  that is based on dimensionality reduction. The synergy between anomaly
  detectors permits to detect twice as many anomalies as the most accurate
  detector,and to reject numerous false positive alarms reported by the
  detectors. Significant anomalous traffic features are extracted from reported
  alarms,hence the labels assigned to the MAWI archive are concise. The results
  on the MAWI traffic are publicly available and updated daily. Also,this
  approach permits to include the results of upcoming anomaly detectors so as to
  improve over time the quality and variety of labels.}

  abstract={In recent years,we have witnessed the advent of computational
  systems capable of generating an immense amount of data in a short time
  period. These applications can be found in areas such as sensor networks,
  financial markets and computer networks. Systems that produce data
  incessantly,creating a continuous Data Stream (DS),can be infinite in size
  and can mutate in its statistical distribution over time. These DS can be used
  as sources for the automatic acquisition of useful knowledge by machine
  learning methods. However,the infinite and mutable nature of these data sets
  can essentially cause new concepts to emerge,which are examples that differ
  significantly from the examples learned by the model. Occurrences of this
  behavior in real-world applications may be credit card fraud or computer
  network intrusions. In this way,the task of detecting these examples,known
  as novelty de- tection,stands out as an important research topic. In general,
  classical methods for detecting novelty are not able to deal with the
  particularities of DS. Thus,differ- ent approaches have been proposed in
  order to create adaptable models that can accomplish this task. However,the
  unpredictable characteristics of DS's create dif- ficulties in the learning
  process,encouraging the search for a more flexible learning. The integration
  of fuzzy set theory concepts is a timely way of making DS learning more
  adaptable to imprecisions. Recently,there have been proposals for machine
  learning models in DS based on fuzzy sets theory with the objective of
  collaborating for the flexibility and adaptability of the knowledge learned in
  DS's. Nonetheless,in the context of novelty detection the proposed approaches
  are few and limited to the domains of study. This paper presents a proposal
  for a fuzzy approach to detecting novelty in DS investigating techniques for
  detection of novelty in DS and machine learning models in DS based on fuzzy
  set theory. The analysis of the results,showed that the proposals favor the
  novelty detection task,facilitating the identification of discrepant data
  through the representation and treatment of imprecise data.},

  title={{A fuzzy multiclass novelty detector for data streams}},
  author={da Silva,Tiago Pinho and Schick,Leonardo and {De Abreu Lopes},Priscilla and {De Arruda Camargo},Heloisa},
  
  abstract={In many real-world applications data arrive continuously,in the
  form of streams. Such data can be used for the acquisition of knowledge by
  machine learning methods. In data streams learning,novelty detection is a
  relevant topic,which aims to identify the emergence of a new concept or a
  drift in the known concept in real time. Most approaches in the literature
  that focus on the novelty detection problem,make assumptions that limit the
  method usefulness. For instance,some methods are designed lying on the
  supposition that labeled data will be available at some time in the stream,
  while others restrict the proposed algorithm to one-class problems. Some
  recent approaches aim to overcome the limitations mentioned,considering
  multiclass problems and unlabeled data sets. In addition,there are also
  proposals that explore concepts of fuzzy set theory to add more flexibility to
  the learning process,although restricted to labeled data sets. In this paper,
  we propose a fuzzy multiclass novelty detector for data streams called FuzzND,
  as a fuzzy extension of the MINAS algorithm. Our algorithm generates a model
  based on fuzzy micro-clusters that provides flexible class boundaries.
  Allowing the identification of different types of novel information,i.e,
  novel classes,extension of classes or outliers more efficiently. Experiments
  show that our approach is promising in dealing with the changes in data
  streams and presents improvements in comparison to the non-fuzzy version.},

  abstract={In Multi-Label Stream Classification (MLSC) examples arriving in a

  abstract="The increment of computer technology use and the continued growth of companies have enabled most financial transactions to be performed through the electronic commerce systems,such as using the credit card system,telecommunication system,healthcare insurance system,etc. Unfortunately,these systems are used by both legitimate users and fraudsters. In addition,fraudsters utilized different approaches to breach the electronic commerce systems. Fraud prevention systems (FPSs) are insufficient to provide adequate security to the electronic commerce systems. However,the collaboration of FDSs with FPSs might be effective to secure electronic commerce systems. Nevertheless,there are issues and challenges that hinder the performance of FDSs,such as concept drift,supports real time detection,skewed distribution,large amount of data etc. This survey paper aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of these issues and challenges that obstruct the performance of FDSs. We have selected five electronic commerce systems; which are credit card,telecommunication,healthcare insurance,automobile insurance and online auction. The prevalent fraud types in those E-commerce systems are introduced closely. Further,state-of-the-art FDSs approaches in selected E-commerce systems are systematically introduced. Then a brief discussion on potential research trends in the near future and conclusion are presented."

  occurrence of concept drift in such an environment is a major challenge. In
  this paper,a new method has been proposed to detect novelty and handle
  concept drift with limited required memory and storage space. The method is
  based on clustering algorithm. It uses Discrete Cosine Transform to build
  compact generative models which are then used to detect novel classes and
  concept drift effectively. The proposed method has been evaluated with seven
  common data sets from various domains. The results indicate its superior
  performance when compared with existing methods in terms of novelty and drift
  detection,computational complexity and memory requirements. {\textcopyright}

  abstract="Player Modelling has been receiving much attention from the game community in the recent years. The ability to build accurate models of player behavior can be useful in many aspects of a game. One important aspect is the tracking of a player’s behavior along time,informing every time a change is perceived. This way,the game Artificial Intelligence can adapt itself to better respond to this new behavior. In order to build models of player behavior,researchers frequently resort to Machine Learning techniques. Such methods work on previously recorded game metrics representing player’s interactions with the game environment. However,if the player changes styles over time,the constructed models get out of date. In order to address this drawback,this work proposes the use of and incremental learning technique to track a player’s behavior during his/her interaction with the game environment. Our approach attempts to automatically detect the moments in time when the player changes behavior. We apply a change detection technique from the area of Data Stream Mining that is based on incremental clustering and novelty detection. We also propose three modifications to the original technique,in order to formalize change detection,improve detection rate and reduce detection delay. Simulations were performed considering data produced by the Unreal Tournament game,showing the applicability of the method to online tracking of a player’s behavior and informing whenever behavior changes occur."

  abstract={Much of the world's data is streaming,time-series data,where
  anomalies give significant information in critical situations; examples abound
  in domains such as finance,IT,security,medical,and energy. Yet detecting
  anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task,requiring detectors to
  process data in real-time,not batches,and learn while simultaneously making
  predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy
  of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark
  (NAB),which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of
  open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on
  streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as
  possible,trigger no false alarms,work with real-world time-series data
  across a variety of domains,and automatically adapt to changing statistics.
  Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB,using a scoring
  algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark
  dataset with labeled,real-world time-series data. We present these
  components,and give results and analyses for several open source,
  commercially-used algorithms. The goal for NAB is to provide a standard,open
  source framework with which the research community can compare and evaluate
  different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data.}

  abstract={A data stream is a flow of unbounded data that arrives continuously
  at high speed. In a dynamic streaming environment,the data changes over the
  time while stream evolves. The evolving nature of data causes essentially the
  appearance of new concepts. This novel concept could be abnormal such as fraud,
  network intrusion,or a sudden fall. It could also be a new normal concept that
  the system has not seen/trained on before. In this paper we propose,develop,
  and evaluate a technique for concept evolution in evolving data streams. The
  novel approach continuously monitors the movement of the streaming data to
  detect any emerging changes. The technique is capable of detecting the emergence
  of any novel concepts whether they are normal or abnormal. It also applies a
  continuous and active learning for assimilating the detected concepts in real
  time. We evaluate our approach on activity recognition domain as an application
  of evolving data streams. The study of the novel technique on benchmarked
  datasets showed its efficiency in detecting new concepts and continuous
  adaptation with low computational cost. {{\textcopyright}} 2016,Springer-Verlag

  title={A framework for clustering evolving data streams},
  author={Aggarwal,Charu C. and Han,Jiawei and Wang,Jianyong and Yu,Philip S.},
  abstract={The clustering problem is a difficult problem for the data stream
  domain. This is because the large volumes of data arriving in a stream renders
  most traditional algorithms too inefficient. In recent years,a few one-pass
  clustering algorithms have been developed for the data stream problem.
  Although such methods address the scalability issues of the clustering
  problem,they are generally blind to the evolution of the data and do not
  address the following issues: (1) The quality of the clusters is poor when the
  data evolves considerably over time. (2) A data stream clustering algorithm
  requires much greater functionality in discovering and exploring clusters over
  different portions of the stream. The widely used practice of viewing data
  stream clustering algorithms as a class of onepass clustering algorithms is
  not very useful from an application point of view. For example,a simple
  one-pass clustering algorithm over an entire data stream of a few years is
  dominated by the outdated history of the stream. The exploration of the stream
  over different time windows can provide the users with a much deeper
  understanding of the evolving behavior of the clusters. At the same time,it is
  not possible to simultaneously perform dynamic clustering over all possible
  time horizons for a data stream of even moderately large volume. This paper
  discusses a fundamentally different philosophy for data stream clustering
  which is guided by application-centered requirements. The idea is divide the
  clustering process into an online component which periodically stores detailed
  summary statistics and an offline component which uses only this summary
  statistics. The offline component is utilized by the analyst who can use a
  wide variety of inputs (such as time horizon or number of clusters) in order
  to provide a quick understanding of the broad clusters in the data stream. The
  problems of efficient choice,storage,and use of this statistical data for a
  fast data stream turns out to be quite tricky. For this purpose,we use the
  concepts of a pyramidal time frame in conjunction with a microclustering
  approach. Our performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data
  sets illustrate the effectiveness,efficiency,and insights provided by our
  approach.},

  author = {Paiva, Elaine Ribeiro de Faria},
  abstract={Mineração de fluxos contínuos de dados é uma
    área de pesquisa emergente que visa extrair conhecimento a partir de
    grandes quantidades de dados,gerados continuamente. Detecção de
    novidade é uma tarefa de classificação que consiste em
    reconhecer que um exemplo ou conjunto de exemplos em um fluxo de dados diferem
    significativamente dos exemplos vistos anteriormente. Essa é uma
    importante tarefa para fluxos contínuos de dados,principalmente porque
    novos conceitos podem aparecer,desaparecer ou evoluir ao longo do tempo. A
    maioria dos trabalhos da literatura apresentam a detecção de
    novidade como uma tarefa de classificação binária. Poucos
    trabalhos tratam essa tarefa como multiclasse,mas usam medidas de
    avaliação binária. Em vários problemas,o correto seria
    tratar a detecção de novidade em fluxos contínuos de dados
    como uma tarefa multiclasse,no qual o conceito conhecido do problema é
    formado por uma ou mais classes, e diferentes novas classes podem aparecer ao
    longo do tempo. Esta tese propõe um novo algoritmo – MINAS – para
    detecção de novidade em fluxos contínuos de dados. MINAS
    considera que a detecção de novidade é uma tarefa multiclasse.
    Na fase de treinamento,MINAS constrói um modelo de decisão com
    base em um conjunto de exemplos rotulados. Na fase de
    aplicação,novos exemplos são classificados usando o modelo de
    decisão atual,ou marcados como desconhecidos. Grupos de exemplos
    desconhecidos podem formar padrões-novidade válidos,que são
    então adicionados ao modelo de decisão. O modelo de decisão
    é atualizado ao longo do fluxo a fim de refletir mudanças nas
    classes conhecidas e permitir inserção de padrões-novidade.
    Esta tese também propõe uma nova metodologia para
    avaliação de algoritmos para detecção de novidade em
    fluxos contínuos de dados. Essa metodologia associa os
    padrões-novidade não rotulados às classes reais do
    problema,permitindo assim avaliar a matriz de confusão que é
    incremental e retangular. Além disso,a metodologia de
    avaliação propõe avaliar os exemplos desconhecidos
    separadamente e utilizar medidas de avaliação multiclasse. Por
    último,esta tese apresenta uma série de experimentos executados
    usando o MINAS e os principais algoritmos da literatura em bases de dados
    artificiais e reais. Além disso,o MINAS foi aplicado a um problema
    real,que consiste no reconhecimento de atividades humanas usando dados de
    acelerômetro. Os resultados experimentais mostram o potencial},

  situations that were never experienced before, is useful for intelligent
  systems aspiring to operate in environments where data are acquired
  incrementally. This characteristic is common to numerous problems in medical
  diagnosis and visual perception. We propose to see novelty detection as a
  case-based reasoning process. Our novelty-detection method is able to detect
  the novel situation, as well as to use the novel events for immediate
  reasoning. To ensure this capacity, we combine statistical and similarity
  inference and learning. This view of CBR takes into account the properties of
  data, such as the uncertainty, and the underlying concepts, such as storage,
  learning, retrieval, and indexing can be formalized and performed
  efficiently.}

  title={Architecture for Internet of Things to minimize human intervention},
  author={Shanbhag, Rupali and Shankarmani, Radha},
  abstract={Today, smart objects in Internet of Things (IOT) are able to detect
  their state and share it with other objects across the Internet, thus
  collaboratively making intelligent decisions on their own. Large number of
  objects is quietly introduced into the web every day. It is impossible for a
  user to keep a track of all objects available around him. Therefore a search
  engine that could find smart objects is used. If an exact object yielding the
  required service is not present then system requires explicit user inputs to
  find alternatives such as name of an alternate object that may provide the
  same service. Humans always find alternatives around them to carry out their
  work smoothly. Service provisioning in IOT should also be made capable of
  providing similar or alternate objects that are aligned with user
  requirements, current context and previous knowledge without any human
  intervention. We propose an architecture that uses Naive Bayesian prediction
  on user history and Ant Colony Optimization for accurately predicting objects
  of user interest so as to reduce the dependency of IOT application on human
  inputs for finding an object match.},

  applied to the intrusion detection problem and proposes IDSA-IoT,a novel

  abstract={Existing machine learning solutions for network-based intrusion detection cannot maintain their reliability over time when facing high-speed networks and evolving attacks. In this paper,we propose BigFlow,an approach capable of processing evolving network traffic while being scalable to large packet rates. BigFlow employs a verification method that checks if the classifier outcome is valid in order to provide reliability. If a suspicious packet is found,an expert may help BigFlow to incrementally change the classification model. Experiments with BigFlow,over a network traffic dataset spanning a full year,demonstrate that it can maintain high accuracy over time. It requires as little as 4% of storage and between 0.05% and 4% of training time,compared with other approaches. BigFlow is scalable,coping with a 10-Gbps network bandwidth in a 40-core cluster commodity hardware.}

  abstract={With the rapid evolution and proliferation of botnets, large-scale cyber attacks such as DDoS, spam emails are also becoming more and more dangerous and serious cyber threats. Because of this, network based security technologies such as Network based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs), Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs), firewalls have received remarkable attention to defend our crucial computer systems, networks and sensitive information from attackers on the Internet. In particular, there has been much effort towards high-performance NIDSs based on data mining and machine learning techniques. However, there is a fatal problem in that the existing evaluation dataset, called KDD Cup 99' dataset, cannot reflect current network situations and the latest attack trends. This is because it was generated by simulation over a virtual network more than 10 years ago. To the best of our knowledge, there is no alternative evaluation dataset. In this paper, we present a new evaluation dataset, called Kyoto 2006+, built on the 3 years of real traffic data (Nov. 2006 ∼ Aug. 2009) which are obtained from diverse types of honeypots. Kyoto 2006+ dataset will greatly contribute to IDS researchers in obtaining more practical, useful and accurate evaluation results. Furthermore, we provide detailed analysis results of honeypot data and share our experiences so that security researchers are able to get insights into the trends of latest cyber attacks and the Internet situations.

Computer security has become a necessity due to the proliferation of information technologies in everyday life. The increase in the number of Internet accesses and the emergence of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT paradigm, are accompanied by new and modern attempts to invade computer systems and networks. Companies are increasingly investing in studies to optimize the detection of these attacks. Institutions are selecting intelligent techniques to test and verify by comparing the best rates of accuracy. This research, therefore, focuses on rigorous state-of-the-art literature on Machine Learning Techniques applied in Internet-of-Things and Intrusion Detection for computer network security. The work aims, therefore, recent and in-depth research of relevant works that deal with several intelligent techniques and their applied intrusion detection architectures in computer networks with emphasis on the Internet of Things and machine learning. More than 95 works on the subject were surveyed, spanning across different themes related to security issues in IoT environments.},

  abstract = {The fast development of IoT in general and wearable smart sensors
  in particular in the context of wellness and healthcare are demanding for
  definition of specific infrastructure supporting real time data analysis for
  anomaly detection, event identification, situation awareness just to mention
  few. The explosion in the development and adoption of these smart wearable
  sensors has contributed to the definition of the Internet of Medical Things
  (IoMT), which is revolutionizing the way healthcare is tackled worldwide. Data
  produced by wearable sensors continuously grow and could be spread among
  clinical centers, hospitals, research labs, yielding to a Big Data management
  problem. In this paper we propose a technological and architectural solution,
  based on Open Source big data technologies to perform real-time analysis of
  wearable sensor data streams. The proposed architecture is composed of four
  distinct layers: a sensing layer, a pre-processing layer (Raspberry Pi), a
  cluster processing layer (Kafka’s broker and Flink’s mini-cluster) and a
  persistence layer (Cassandra database). A performance evaluation of each layer
  has been carried out by considering CPU and memory usage for accomplishing a
  simple anomaly detection task using the REALDISP dataset.}

  abstract = {The advent of connected devices and omnipresence of Internet have paved way for intruders to attack networks, which leads to cyber-attack, financial loss, information theft in healthcare, and cyber war. Hence, network security analytics has become an important area of concern and has gained intensive attention among researchers, off late, specifically in the domain of anomaly detection in network, which is considered crucial for network security. However, preliminary investigations have revealed that the existing approaches to detect anomalies in network are not effective enough, particularly to detect them in real time. The reason for the inefficacy of current approaches is mainly due the amassment of massive volumes of data though the connected devices. Therefore, it is crucial to propose a framework that effectively handles real time big data processing and detect anomalies in networks. In this regard, this paper attempts to address the issue of detecting anomalies in real time. Respectively, this paper has surveyed the state-of-the-art real-time big data processing technologies related to anomaly detection and the vital characteristics of associated machine learning algorithms. This paper begins with the explanation of essential contexts and taxonomy of real-time big data processing, anomalous detection, and machine learning algorithms, followed by the review of big data processing technologies. Finally, the identified research challenges of real-time big data processing in anomaly detection are discussed.}
