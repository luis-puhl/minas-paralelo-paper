abstract = {Various communication protocols are currently used in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. One of the protocols that are already standardized by ISO is MQTT protocol (ISO / IEC 20922: 2016). Many IoT developers use this protocol because of its minimal bandwidth requirement and low memory consumption. Sometimes, IoT device sends confidential data that should only be accessed by authorized people or devices. Unfortunately, the MQTT protocol only provides authentication for the security mechanism which, by default, does not encrypt the data in transit thus data privacy, authentication, and data integrity become problems in MQTT implementation. This paper discusses several reasons on why there are many IoT system that does not implement adequate security mechanism. Next, it also demonstrates and analyzes how we can attack this protocol easily using several attack scenarios. Finally, after the vulnerabilities of this protocol have been examined, we can improve our security awareness especially in MQTT protocol and then implement security mechanism in our MQTT system to prevent such attack. {\textcopyright} 2018, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is the smart network which connects smart objects over the Internet. The Internet is un- trusted and unreliable network and thus IoT network is vulner- able to different kind of attacks. Conventional encryption and authentication techniques sometimes fail on IoT based network and intrusion may succeed to destroy the network. So, it is necessary to design intrusion detection system for such network. In our paper, we detect routing attacks such as sinkhole and selective forwarding. We have also tried to prevent our net- work from these attacks. We designed detection and prevention algorithm, i.e., KMA(Key Match Algorithm) and CBA(Cluster- Based Algorithm) in MatLab simulation environment. We gave two intrusion detection mechanisms and compared their results as well. True positive intrusion detection rate for our work is between 50{\%} to 80{\%} with KMA and 76{\%} to 96{\%} with CBA algorithm.},

title = {{Cyber-physical systems information gathering: A smart home case study}},
abstract = {With the growth in the use of Cyber-Physical Systems, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is a corresponding increase in the potential attack footprint of personal and corporate users. In this paper, we explore the potential for exploiting information retrieved from two IoT devices which, seemingly, are unlikely to store substantial amounts of data. We specifically focus on prominent smart home devices for the purpose of obtaining compromising information. We undertake a collection and analysis process, constrained by the limitations placed upon three types of adversaries, namely: forensic passive, forensic active and real-time active. The former two adversaries aim to comply with the requirements of forensic soundness, whereas the real-time active adversary does not have these constraints and therefore more closely models a malicious real-world attacker. The findings show that a variety of device data is available to even the passive adversary, and this data can be used to determine the actions and/or presence of an individual at a given time based on their interactions with the IoT device. These interactions can be both user initiated (e.g. powering on or off a switch or light) and device initiated (e.g. background polling).},

@article{Acar2018,
abstract = {In this paper, we present two web-based attacks against local IoT de- vices that any malicious web page or third-party script can perform, even when the devices are behind NATs. In our attack scenario, a victim visits the attacker's website, which contains a malicious script that communicates with IoT devices on the local network that have open HTTP servers. We show how the malicious script can circumvent the same-origin policy by exploiting error messages on the HTML5 MediaError interface or by carrying out DNS rebinding attacks. We demonstrate that the attacker can gather sensitive infor- mation from the devices (e.g., unique device identifiers and precise geolocation), track and profile the owners to serve ads, or control the devices by playing arbitrary videos and rebooting. We propose potential countermeasures to our attacks that users, browsers, DNS providers, and IoT vendors can implement.},

  abstract = {MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in
  implementing large-scale data-intensive applications on commodity clusters.
  However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model
  that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper fo-cuses on
  one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across
  multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning
  algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new
  framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the
  scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark
  introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD
  is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that
  can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in
  iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39
  GB dataset with sub-second response time.}

abstract = {Internet technology is very pervasive today. The number of devices connected to the Internet, those with a digital identity, is increasing day by day. With the developments in the technology, Internet of Things (IoT) become important part of human life. However, it is not well defined and secure. Now, various security issues are considered as major problem for a full-fledged IoT environment. There exists a lot of security challenges with the proposed architectures and the technologies which make the backbone of the Internet of Things. Some efficient and promising security mechanisms have been developed to secure the IoT environment, however, there is a lot to do. The challenges are ever increasing and the solutions have to be ever improving. Therefore, aim of this paper is to discuss the history, background, statistics of IoT and security based analysis of IoT architecture. In addition, we will provide taxonomy of security challenges in IoT environment and taxonomy of various defense mechanisms. We conclude our paper discussing various research challenges that still exist in the literature, which provides better understanding of the problem, current solution space, and future research directions to defend IoT against different attacks.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) allows large amounts and variety of
  devices to connect, interact and exchange data. The IoT network creates
  numerous opportunities for novel attacks that can compromise information and

  decades, mostly employing traditional data mining and machine learning
  techniques that require an offline phase for model training on large amounts
  of data. This paper presents three data stream novelty detection techniques
  applied to the intrusion detection problem and proposes IDSA-IoT, a novel
  implementation architecture, which combines the use of resources at the edge
  of the network and a public cloud. After an extensive empirical evaluation,
  results show that it is possible to identify new attack patterns soon after
  their emergence and to adapt the models in an efficient way.},

  abstract="Data stream mining is an emergent research area that aims at
  extracting knowledge from large amounts of continuously generated data.
  Novelty detection (ND) is a classification task that assesses if one or a set
  of examples differ significantly from the previously seen examples. This is an
  important task for data stream, as new concepts may appear, disappear or
  evolve over time. Most of the works found in the ND literature presents it as
  a binary classification task. In several data stream real life problems, ND
  must be treated as a multiclass task, in which, the known concept is composed
  by one or more classes and different new classes may appear. This work
  proposes MINAS, an algorithm for ND in data streams. MINAS deals with ND as a
  multiclass task. In the initial training phase, MINAS builds a decision model
  based on a labeled data set. In the online phase, new examples are classified
  using this model, or marked as unknown. Groups of unknown examples can be used
  later to create valid novelty patterns (NP), which are added to the current
  model. The decision model is updated as new data come over the stream in order
  to reflect changes in the known classes and allow the addition of NP. This
  work also presents a set of experiments carried out comparing MINAS and the
  main novelty detection algorithms found in the literature, using artificial
  and real data sets. The experimental results show the potential of the
  proposed algorithm.",

  abstract = {Applications that require real-time processing of high-volume data steams are pushing the limits of traditional data processing infrastructures. These stream-based applications include market feed processing and electronic trading on Wall Street, network and infrastructure monitoring, fraud detection, and command and control in military environments. Furthermore, as the "sea change" caused by cheap micro-sensor technology takes hold, we expect to see everything of material significance on the planet get "sensor- tagged" and report its state or location in real time. This sensorization of the real world will lead to a "green field" of novel monitoring and control applications with high-volume and low-latency processing requirements. Recently, several technologies have emerged - including off-the-shelf stream processing engines - specifically to address the challenges of processing high-volume, real-time data without requiring the use of custom code. At the same time, some existing software technologies, such as main memory DBMSs and rule engines, are also being "repurposed" by marketing departments to address these applications. In this paper, we outline eight requirements that a system software should meet to excel at a variety of real-time stream processing applications. Our goal is to provide high-level guidance to information technologists so that they will know what to look for when evaluation alternative stream processing solutions. As such, this paper serves a purpose comparable to the requirements papers in relational DBMSs and on-line analytical processing. We also briefly review alternative system software technologies in the context of our requirements. The paper attempts to be vendor neutral, so no specific commercial products are mentioned.},

BigFlow employs a verification method that checks if the classifier outcome is valid in order to provide reliability. If a suspicious packet is found, an expert may help BigFlow to incrementally change the classification model. Experiments with BigFlow, over a network traffic dataset spanning a full year, demonstrate that it can maintain high accuracy over time. It requires as little as 4% of storage and between 0.05% and 4% of training time, compared with other approaches. BigFlow is scalable, coping with a 10-Gbps network bandwidth in a 40-core cluster commodity hardware."

abstract="An Intrusion Detection System (IDS)Intrusion Detection Systemis a security mechanism that is intended to dynamically inspect traffic in order to detect any suspicious behaviour or launched attacks. However, it is a challenging task to apply IDS for large and high dimensional data streams. Data streams have characteristics that are quite distinct from those of statistical databases, which greatly impact on the performance of the anomaly-based ID algorithms used in the detection process. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, the processing of large data as they arrive (real-time), the dynamic nature of data streams, the curse of dimensionality, limited memory capacity and high complexity. Therefore, the main challenge in this area of research is to design efficient data-driven ID systems that are capable of efficiently dealing with data streams by considering these specific traffic characteristics. This chapter provides an overview of some of the relevant work carried out in three major fields related to the topic, namely feature selections (FS), intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly detectionAnomaly detection in multi data streams. This overview is intended to provide the reader with a better understanding of the major recent works in the area. By critically investigating and combining those three fields, researchers and practitioners will be better able to develop efficient and robust IDS for data streams. At the end of this chapter, we provide two basic models: an Unsupervised Feature Selection to Improve Detection Accuracy for Anomaly Detection (UFSAD) and its extension (UFSAD-MS) for multi streams, that could reduce the volume and the dimensionality of the big data resulting from the streams. The reduction is based on the selection of only the relevant features and removing irrelevant and redundant ones. The last section of the chapter provides an example of the developed UFSAD model, followed by some experimental results. UFSAD-MS is provided as a conceptual model as it is in the implementation phase.",

  monitoring made particularly difficult due to the lack of ground truth. The
  goal of the present article is to assist researchers in the evaluation of
  detectors by providing them with labeled anomaly traffic traces. We aim at
  automatically finding anomalies in the MAWI archive using a new methodology
  that combines different and independent detectors. A key challenge is to
  compare the alarms raised by these detectors , though they operate at
  different traffic granularities. The main contribution is to propose a
  reliable graph-based methodology that combines any anomaly detector outputs.
  We evaluated four unsupervised combination strategies; the best is the one
  that is based on dimensionality reduction. The synergy between anomaly
  detectors permits to detect twice as many anomalies as the most accurate
  detector, and to reject numerous false positive alarms reported by the
  detectors. Significant anomalous traffic features are extracted from reported
  alarms, hence the labels assigned to the MAWI archive are concise. The results
  on the MAWI traffic are publicly available and updated daily. Also, this
  approach permits to include the results of upcoming anomaly detectors so as to
  improve over time the quality and variety of labels.}
